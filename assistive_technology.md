# Smart canes for the Visually Impaired:
 - Prototypes of canes equipped with sensors and GPS technology to help individuals with visual impairments navigate their surroundings more safely. These canes may provide haptic feedback or audible cues to alert
   users about obstacles or changes in their environment.

# Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Communication:
 - Prototypes that use brain signals to control communication devices for individuals with severe motor disabilities. These systems may enable users to type, browse the internet, or communicate with others
   through the power of their thoughts.

# Exoskeletons for Mobility:
 - Assistive exoskeleton prototypes designed to help individuals with mobility impairments regain or enhance their ability to walk. These exoskeletons can be customized based on the user's specific needs and
   may include features like powered joints and balance assistance.

# Customizable Communication Devices:
 - Prototypes of communication devices that can be tailored to the specific needs and abilities of individual with speech or communication disorders. These devices may include adaptive interfaces, predictive text,
   and voice synthesis technologies.

# Wearable Health Monitoring Devices:
 - Wearable prototypes that monitor vital signs and health parameters for individuals with chronic conditions. These devices may provide real-time data to both users and healthcare providers, enabling proactive
   management of health conditions.

# Accessible Gaming Controllers:
 - Prototypes of gaming controllers designed for individuals with limited mobility. These controllers may include customizable input options, adaptive features, and interfaces that cater to a wide range of abilities.

# Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses for the Hearing Impaired:
 - Prototypes of AR glasses equipped with real-time speech-to-text translation to help individuals with hearing impairments follow conversations more easily. These glasses may display transcriptions of spoken
   words in real-time.

# Assistive Robots for Daily Tasks:
 - Prototypes of robots designed to assist individuals with physical disabilities in performing daily tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and grabbing objects. These robots may be controlled through voice commmands
   or customized interfaces.

# Sensory Substitution Devices:
 - Prototypes that convert information from one sensory modality (e.g., visual information) into another (e.g., tactile or auditory feedback) to assist individuals with sensory impairments in perceiving their
   environments.
